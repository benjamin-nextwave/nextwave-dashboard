# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from 6 requirement categories. UIST split across Phase 1 (global styling) and Phase 3 (task-specific styling). DTSK grouped with COMP in Phase 2 (default tasks created during company creation).
- [01-01]: Used src/ directory structure for clean separation from config files
- [01-01]: shadcn/ui initialized with Neutral base color and OKLCH color format (Tailwind v4 default)
- [01-01]: Supabase singleton pattern (no @supabase/ssr) -- no auth means no cookie management needed
- [01-01]: Manual database types matching SQL schema -- can replace with auto-generated later
- [01-02]: dates.ts is a pure utility (no 'use client') -- works from both server and client components
- [01-03]: Vitest as test runner -- zero-config TypeScript support, fast execution
- [01-04]: Semantic Tailwind color classes throughout (text-foreground, text-muted-foreground, border-border, bg-background)
- [02-01]: Parse warmupStartDate with 'T00:00:00' suffix to avoid timezone offset issues
- [02-01]: Zero-based day offsets (0-5) for intuitive "days after start" counting
- [02-01]: DefaultTaskDefinition type exported for reuse in UI components
- [02-02]: Client-side filtering for open task count (avoid Supabase embedded filter edge cases)
- [02-02]: CompanyInsert type with optional nullable fields (DB has defaults)
- [02-02]: Type assertions for Supabase return values where generic schema doesn't narrow

### Pending Todos

- User must configure Supabase project and add credentials to .env.local before database connectivity works

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
